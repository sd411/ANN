# ANN
ANN 
(for predicting house prices and its evaluation and tuning.A little tweak and this model can also be used to predict the probability of a customer leaving a bank or not using the churn modelling dataset)
For Predicting housing prices or any continous variable use a linear activation function in final layer and the cost function preferred is mean squared error.
For probability related predictions use sigmoid function for a single class and softmax function for multiple classes.
